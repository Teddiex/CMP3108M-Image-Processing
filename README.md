## Feedback

C1 Report (30%): 75
Task 1-4 achieved well with all required images presented and justification of selection of method or steps involved clearly written. Task 2 can be improved by having better parameter justification. Good attempt with Task 5. The classification may be improved by exploring ways of breaking up objects using morphological operators or other advanced method. Accuracy achieved well. The student can also exploit a bit more around shape features.Task 6's dice score formula should be written down as well.
C2 Code Implementation (70%): 78
Code commented and formatted well. There are some comments may be only make sense to author himself.  Written in correct script. It is better to compare class-wise dice score, instead of comparing binary segmentation. This will be more accurately reflecting the recognition results.Code is attached as appendix.
